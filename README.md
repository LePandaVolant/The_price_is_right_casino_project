# The_price_is_right_casino_project
A Python project, inspired by the game 'The Price is Right' and adapted to a casino style.
This project aims to create an interactive game based on 'The Price is Right' concept. The goal is to find the most efficient method to win in the fewest possible moves. Subsequently, the law of large numbers will be used to multiply the winnings according to the number of attempts it took to find the correct result.
